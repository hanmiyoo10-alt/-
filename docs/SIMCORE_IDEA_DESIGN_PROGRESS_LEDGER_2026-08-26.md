# SimCore Idea Design Progress Ledger — 2026-08-26

Status: `CURRENT GLOBAL IDEA-DESIGN + APPLY/HARVEST LEDGER · ORIGINAL POOLS CLOSED · SYSTEM-IDEA SWEEP ACTIVE · 15 SYS DESIGNS FROZEN · NO RUNTIME CHANGE`

Purpose: current global design/apply/harvest progress across original SimCore ideas and the active system/operations idea sweep.

- `docs/SIMCORE_UNIFIED_IDEA_CLASSIFICATION_POLICY.md`

## 1. Original idea pools

```text
Original NR Difficulty 1/2/3 harvests = COMPLETE
Original current NR harvest queue    = EMPTY
Original gate-open R design sweep    = CLOSED
Original R DOC APPLY queue           = EMPTY
Permanent fixture expansion          = COMPLETE
```

Implemented original NON_RUNTIME ideas remain:

```text
S-09 / S-10 / S-11 / S-12 / M-10 / M-11 / M-13
```

Frozen runtime core remains parked:

```text
S-01 / S-02 / S-03 / S-04 / S-07 / S-08
```

Gated/future original ideas remain under their existing POST_M2_3 / POST_M2_4 / EVIDENCE / EXTERNAL / genuine-release-proof / M2-slice / FUTURE gates.

## 2. Frozen system designs

SYS-21 Forensic Classification Consistency Check
= MEDIUM / I5 / D3 / NON_RUNTIME / FROZEN / NR_DOC_ONLY / APPLY HOLD
```

SYS-21 contract:

```text
one bounded forensic item
+ current classification/disposition
+ cited proof/evidence maturity
+ cited impact/recurrence/attribution/mitigation facts
→ human semantic consistency audit
```

It detects evidence over-promotion, active-blocker under-classification, attribution/recurrence overclaim, proof substitution, missing-evidence-as-failure mistakes, test-intent overreach, mitigation/revalidation confusion, and stale current dispositions. It never auto-promotes/demotes WATCH / DEFER / FIX / BLOCKER, discovers recurrence, closes a gate, or mutates source authorities.

## 3. Current system counts

```text
TOTAL SYSTEM IDEAS = 52
FROZEN              = 15
OPEN NOW            = 25
GATED/DEPENDENCY    = 12

NR_DOC_ONLY         = 10
NR_EXECUTABLE       = 4
NR_PROTECTED        = 1
NR_UNASSESSED       = 37
```

## 4. Current next design

Remaining highest-priority edge:

```text
I5 / D3 / NOW
SYS-31 Version-Bump Blast-Radius Check
SYS-35 Repository Transaction Ledger
SYS-38 Architecture Contract Diff Reporter
```

Current downstream-leverage selection:

```text
NEXT SYSTEM DESIGN = SYS-38 Architecture Contract Diff Reporter
```

Reason:

```text
SYS-13 / SYS-17 / SYS-22 / SYS-21 now form a bounded evidence-integrity chain.
The next physical architecture step after v0.64.7 live close is M2-3 Edit Reconcile extraction.
SYS-38 therefore has the strongest immediate downstream leverage:
make reviewed architecture contract deltas visible without replacing Contracts v2 or its checker.
SYS-31 becomes material at the next version bump; SYS-35 is a broader transaction-history layer that can follow the current close/receipt controls.
```

After SYS-38, recompute the remaining I5/D3 edge rather than precommitting a static order.

## 5. Apply/implementation hold

```text
CURRENT SYSTEM DESIGN SWEEP = ACTIVE
SYS-19 application     = HOLD
SYS-01 application     = HOLD
SYS-51 application     = HOLD
SYS-08 application     = HOLD
SYS-10 implementation  = HOLD
SYS-48 application     = HOLD
SYS-03 implementation  = HOLD
SYS-09 application     = HOLD
SYS-50 implementation  = HOLD
SYS-42 implementation  = HOLD / PROTECTED
SYS-11 application     = HOLD
SYS-13 application     = HOLD
SYS-17 implementation  = HOLD
SYS-22 application     = HOLD
SYS-21 application     = HOLD
```

Do not materialize/implement these frozen items until the current bounded system design sweep closes or priority is explicitly changed.

SYS-42 additionally requires a dedicated protected implementation transaction; it is not ordinary SAFE_NON_RUNTIME harvestable merely because it remains non-runtime.

## 6. Verification WATCH preservation

Existing non-blocking focused/direct-execution WATCHes for S-10/S-11/M-10/M-11/M-13 remain unchanged.

SYS-13 explicitly preserves them: a generic permanent-CI PASS does not establish that a named focused mode/test directly executed unless an exact step/log proves it.

SYS-17 preserves the same distinction at slot level: a WATCH-only `NOT_CLAIMED` slot remains visible but does not become a current blocker or justify unrelated CI restructuring.

SYS-22 adds intent clarity without changing execution evidence: a focused test intent row never implies permanent-CI discovery, and a permanent deterministic suite never implies natural live validation or genuine release E2E proof.

SYS-21 adds a human forensic consistency layer: one direct symptom does not manufacture root-cause attribution/FIX/BLOCKER, while an actual authoritative stop condition must not remain hidden behind a harmless WATCH label. Its review findings do not mutate the owning classification automatically.

SYS-10, SYS-03, SYS-50, and SYS-17 are executable by design but not implemented, therefore no focused tool/CI execution claim exists for them yet. SYS-42 is protected executable governance tooling by design but likewise has no implementation/test/CI claim yet. SYS-09, SYS-11, SYS-13, SYS-22, and SYS-21 are document-only by design.

## 7. Production boundary

```text
SimCore production = v0.64.7 Cross-Reload Cache Observer Continuity
release-simcore commit = a7ce8ce33a97797630f885c6753415e4b2ccc7fc
release blob = 676b7e2ca3d55a6676b7a5d3bfaf95be5ee6e9b0
current production gate = 06407_RELOAD_CACHE_CONTINUITY_REAL_LONG_CHAT
live gate = PENDING_REAL_LONG_CHAT
checkpoint = M2-2
```

No system-design transaction changes those runtime/release facts.

## 8. Verdict

```text
ORIGINAL POOLS = CLOSED / UNCHANGED
SYSTEM-IDEA DESIGN SWEEP = ACTIVE
SYSTEM DESIGNS FROZEN = 15 / 52
CURRENT NEXT = SYS-38 Architecture Contract Diff Reporter
SYSTEM APPLY / IMPLEMENTATION = HELD
SYS-42 APPLY CLASS = NR_PROTECTED
v0.64.7 LIVE GATE = PENDING_REAL_LONG_CHAT
```
